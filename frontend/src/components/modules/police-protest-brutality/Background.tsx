    <h1>Police Brutality in America</h1>
    <p>
      In the aftermath of George Floyd's murder on May 25, 2020 by the hands of the former police officer
      Derek Chauvin, massive protests swept the United States demanding police be held accountable for their
      actions. George Floyd, a black man, was murdered when Derek Chauvin placed his knee on George's neck for
      9 minutes and 49 seconds, asphyxiating him, while three other officers watched and did not intervene.
      The video of his death quickly went viral, sparking the outrage felt by millions of Americans protesting racism and
      police brutality from all 50 states, as well as around the world.
      <br />
      While George Floyd's death sparked a massive wave of protests, this is by no means the beginning of the story.
      This is the latest in a long chain of events fighting against racism, oppression, and police brutality in America.

    <h2>Police brutality at protests against police brutality</h2>
    <p>
      As an estimated 15 - 26 million Americans took to the streets, the vast majority of protests were peaceful. Some, however,
      did become violent leading to looting, arson, and skirmishes with the police. It is not clear what portion of protests
      that became violent were incited by the protesters or the police. However, there are hundreds of videos and anecdotes
      of aggressive violent action being taken by the police for seemingly no reason. Violence performed by the police include 
      tear-gassing, shooting rubber bullets, beatings with batons, and pepper-spraying protesters, bystanders, and journalists.

    <h2>Aftermath: The conviction of Derek Chauvin</h2>
    <p>
      On April 20, 2021, Derek Chauvin was found guilty on three counts: unintentional second-degree murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter.
