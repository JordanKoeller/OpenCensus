    <p>
      Police brutality videos were crowdsourced via the twitter bot <a href="https://twitter.com/ArchiveThisBLM" target="_blank">
        @ArchiveThisBLM
      </a> Whenever the bot is tagged in a reply to a tweet containing a video that video and the original tweet are automatically
      archived to a database outside of Twitter.com. Thus, some of these videos may have been removed from Twitter.com, but we still
      have records of them.
