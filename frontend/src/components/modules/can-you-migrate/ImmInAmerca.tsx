    <h1>American Immigration Policy</h1>
    <p>
      In order to answer the question "Could your family move to America" we need to get an idea
      of how many people were coming to America throughout history and where they were coming from.
      Fortunately that data is readily available through the U.S. Census Bureau.
  </p>
    <p>
      With these data we need to impose today's immigration policy onto that data and "see what happens"
      Modern immigration policy has three main components that dictate how many people can immigrate to America.
  </p>

    <h3>
      Avenues for Immigration
  </h3>
    <p>
      Modern immigration policy is defined in a document called the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). This is
    a law that was written in <b> 1965</b> that puts restrictions and regulations on who can obtain a U.S. Visa
          and become a Lawful Permanent Resident. It provides three broad avenues by which immigrants may come to America.
  </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b> 675,000</b> visas may be earned by immigrants attempting to come to America through the "Normal way".
        This includes employment-based immigration as well as people trying to better their lives and find opportunity
        in America.
      </li>
      <li>
        On top of the 675,000 visas, the INA does not set a cap on the number of U.S. Citizens' spouses, parents,
        and children under 21 that may apply to become a lawful permanent resident of the United States.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lastly, the INA dictates that the U.S. President meet with Congress once per fiscal year and set the maximum number
        of refugees allowed to become permanent residents of the United States. Under the Trump Administration in the
        fiscal year of 2020 this is set to allow a maximum of <b> 18,000 refugees.</b>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>

      Note that these three avenues are not guarantees. They only provide the means by which an individual may become a lawful
    permanent resident.
      </p>
    <h3>
      Country Quotas and the Diversity Program
  </h3>
    <p>
      To encourage diversity in immigrants moving to America Congress has enacted two policies: The quota system and the Diversity
    Visa Program. The quota system states that <b> No more than 7% of all immigrants in a fiscal year may come from a singular country</b>
      This ensures that one singular country cannot make up the majority of immigrants coming to America. While this does encourage diversity,
      this also has the effect of creating waitlists to be allowed to immigrate to America. If a country has already contributed 7% of the immigrants
      in the fiscal year that somebody applies, any further applicants will be put on a waitlist to be processed in the next fiscal year.
  </p>
    <p>
      The Diversity Visa Program is a program designed to reserve 55,000 of the 675,000 annual visas to be used by people immigrating from traditionally
      under-represented countries from different regions across the globe. To be eligble for one of these visas, an immigrant must be coming from a country
      of origin that has contributed fewer than 50,000 immigrants to the united states over the past five years. Additionally, they must have a high school diploma
      or have worked for at least two years in a profession requiring two years of technical training in the past five years. Acceptance through this avenue is done
      through a lottery system.
