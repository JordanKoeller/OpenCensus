# About
## OpenJustice is an open-source project aimed at presenting information about modern American society in a data-driven, interractive way.
While information about any topic you may be interested in is readily available on the internet, most of it is hard to understand because we have no context in which to understand it. OpenJustice attempts to fix this problem by presenting data about our society in an novel, interractive way. Through interractivity we provide a meaningful framework to understand cumbersome statistical data. It allows individuals to more easily connect their own story, their family's story, or their community's story to statistical data about the story of America's historical and modern-day society.

## OpenJustice is transparent.
Any claims made on OpenJustice are fact-checked and must include a reference to where the data was found and how it was collected. We rely heavily on data from the U.S. Census Bureau to power our analyses, though data from other credible sources is present. See the bottom of any page for information on where the data was found and how the analysis was made.

## OpenJustice is an open-source, community-driven project.
OpenJustice is an open-source project made from the contributions of many individuals. Anybody with an idea and the technical know-how to create a page may submit a project. However, in order for the project to be included on OpenJustice.info it has been rigorously vetted for factual accuracy, validity, and relevance. It also must meet our citations and references guidelines to be approved.
